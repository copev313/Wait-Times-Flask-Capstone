# QueueTrackr
 A capstone project to demonstrate skills in Python's Flask microframework.
 
 This Flask application demonstrates the following skills:
  - Creating routes and serving HTML pages using templates.
  - Collecting user data with forms.
  - Storing and accessing data in databases.
  - Authenticating users and providing user accounts.
  - Deploying applications on the web.

## My Project Objective:

My goal was to create a potential amusement park attraction wait time tracker. This rendition focuses on the admin dashboard portion of the application and has plenty of room for improvement and additions possibly in the future (some ideas listed below).

### Ideas for Improvement & Features:
 - Implement a system for creating eTickets via the Tickets section. Add a Ticket model to the DB to ticket validity and other attributes.
- Adjust the side menu to be responsive and mobile friendly.
- Create a user dashboard.
